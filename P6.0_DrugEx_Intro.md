The DrugEx parts (P6.1_DrugEx_data_prep, P6.2_DrugEx_qsar and P6.3_DrugEx_de_novo) needs te be run on Google Colab for GPU acceleration. Running P6 generates 1000 compounds (generated.tsv) which should be downloaded and added to the data folder. 

DrugEx was developed in order to explore the drug space, DrugEx generates ligands. DrugEx uses the idea of reinforcement learning. In reinforcement learning, an agent in a state takes an action and learns by observing the environment. The observation is based on the reward function. This demo version of DrugEx is based on the pre-trained§ DrugEx v2 [1]. In this version, the agent generates ligands with a recurrent neural network sequentially by the SMILES (token by token). The generated SMILES sequence observed by the environment, a QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) model. The QSAR model is a scalarized multi-objective function consisting of the binding affinity score and synthetic accessibility score.

In the future, Based on the scaffold prepared in the previous part novel chemical structures could be generated with Scaffold-Constrained Drug Design with Graph Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning of DrugEx v3. However, for this project we could only use the DrugEx-Demo. This demo will generate novel chemical structures as ligands for the BACE receptor, but without input of the desired scaffold.

§ The pre-training and fine-tuning on the target data sets up the generator for the reinforcement learning phase, i.e. the generator first learns how to generate valid molecules and then to generate molecules for the target.
